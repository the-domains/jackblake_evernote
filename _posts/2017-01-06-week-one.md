# Week One

Writing our own [Tools for Titans of Kansas City][0].

See the Group **[Here][0]**

What better way to go mainstream than starting somewhere attached to TIm Ferriss followers.

IF it wasn't for the 4HWW and his online databases of knowledge, I'd be lacking a lot of indeed needed curiosities to fill up my time. Some say hobby, but experimenting is in the cards for me.

So in honor of that, here's where I'll start my mandate of gratitude: curating a collection of titans in my own life. No matter how big or small, young or old, if these men & women capture my attention in an upstanding way, I'll cultivate some empty space and spend my time sharing the stories that unfold.
