# Week One

Writing our own [Tools for Titans of Kansas City][0].

See the Group **[Here][0]**

What better way to go mainstream than starting somewhere attached to TIm Ferriss followers.

IF it wasn't for the 4HWW and his online databases of knowledge, I'd be lacking a lot of indeed needed curiosities to fill up my time. Some say hobby, but experimenting is in the cards for me. 

So in honor of that, here's where I'll start my mandate of gratitude: curating a collection of titans in my own life. No matter how big or small, young or old, if these men & women capture my attention in an upstanding way, I'll cultivate some empty space and spend my time sharing the stories that unfold.

The week after Episode 11 was finished, we were at an event with a spritely gentleman named Ron Logan. He's an Iridologist. 

Here's the wikipedia definition:

(also known as iridodiagnosis or iridiagnosis) is an alternative medicine technique whose proponents claim that patterns, colors, and other characteristics of the iris can be examined to determine information about a patient's systemic health.

Check him out here.

Tyler: say there was an intro and a short closing on each, could you make 10 \[solo point of value\] IG posts with this keynote?
