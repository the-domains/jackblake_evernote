# If we were to train to be as strong as Tarzan, where would you start?

Tarzan was a beast in the newest movie. He was a man among men. 

Where would we be if we thought of Tarzan as a celebrity? Yeah, a celebrity. 

Now, and in plato's narrative of ancient Greece, we desire to be like celebrities of the time. The challenge is to change your definition of a celebrity. 

But where would you start? 

I'd say go to the very beginning, train yourself to be on your all fours (hands and knees)
