# If you had to train to be as strong as Tarzan, where would you start?

Tarzan was a beast in the newest movie. He was a man among men.

Where would we be if we thought of Tarzan as a celebrity? Yeah, a celebrity.

Now, and in plato's narrative of ancient Greece, we desire to be like celebrities of the time. The challenge is to change your definition of a celebrity.

But where would you start?

I'd say go to the very beginning, train yourself to be on all fours (hands and knees).
