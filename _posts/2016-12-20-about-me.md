## MY BIO

My first day "out" of college (2015) I was on an airplane to Croatia for a week long Skipper Academy. This was the ONE THING I had been working for the previous 5 months.

I passed the academy and worked for 7 weeks as a Yacht Week Skipper that summer. My network would never be the same again. And that was the goal; to build a worldwide network of young professionals and millennials.

I did it because I listened to podcasts, read the Four Hour Workweek, and loved the idea of lifestyle design. I didn't want to pretend that the parties were everything anymore. Simply put, I_wanted to be in The Arena and not just watching from the outside..._

Now, I work Helio Food Company. I'm a Videographer honored and enthusiastic about the task on my hands---to document and distribute positive true transparent social media.

My top Priorities:

1. Promote The Science and Personal Experimenting with metabolic therapeutics and \#KetoClarity \#HelioFoodCompany \#KetoCommunity \#LowCarbHighFat
