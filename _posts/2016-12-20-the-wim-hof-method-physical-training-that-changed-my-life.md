# **THE WIM HOF METHOD: PHYSICAL TRAINING THAT CHANGED MY LIFE.**

"I feel stronger from within. I feel like I've learned how to train the tiny muscles surrounding my capillaries. I know that sounds strange. You'll have to feel it to understand it, I think."

TLDR: Through cold water training & breath retention, the Wim Hof Method will fire up your metabolism, increase your mitochondria, make you stronger, regulate your hormones, and ultimately make you wonder why cold & O2 haven't been a standard part of every athlete's training regiment throughout history.   
Start here-- [Wimhofmethod.com][0]  
A few testimonies & interviews that turned me onto the program:  
Laird Hamilton: My favorite of this collection as he's a trained athlete before the WHM.

I'm 40\. I lost about 25lbs and not on purpose. I didn't start the program to lose weight. I joined the program to try to help with my circulation. I have a history of shoulder dislocations (20/shoulder + surgeries) that have ultimately damaged my vessels enough (as well as instigated arthritis) to make sleeping a solid night merely impossible. I figured the cold & breathing training would be a new approach towards training my circulatory system. And I was right. I sleep now without my hands going numb, which used to force me to roll over every hour. I haven't had any arthritic pains in the last 6 months, either.   
I also learned to use my breathing (Hof & Tummo style) to warm my hands. I have learned what brown fat is. I have learned what kind of heat it can produce, what it feels like, and how to move that heat around my body in the cold shower. I haven't had a warm shower in 6 months now. I don't _endure_ cold water. I seek it. I enjoy it. I'm kind of addicted to it, actually.   
When I began I was scared of cold showers, albeit admittedly intrigued. The program starts you off at 10 seconds in the cold, and you work your way up. (The ice bath challenge is at week 8) For reference, I'll give my faucet a scale of 10 (hot) to 1 (cold) so you can understand where this is going-  
Let's imagine that--  
10 is too hot, unbearable.   
7 is that warm/hot I used for my showers for my whole life.   
5 is fine, but getting cool.   
3 is cold, uncomfortable.   
1 is straight up unbearable. Needles.   
I began going from 7 to 3 for ten seconds. Then back to 7 for a relief. I did that for a week. The next week was 30 seconds. The next week was 1 minute, etcetera, until things really shifted. And this is where it gets interesting. My relief temperature shifted. Once I could manage 1 for a few minutes, I found that my relief temperature would be around 3 or 4\. And I found 7 to be annoying.   
Enter ice buckets. I brought ice buckets into the shower to dunk my hands and feet when I took a break from the cold shower. I'd take a cold shower, turn off the faucet for relief, then rotate dunking my hands and feet in ice water. When I would enter the cold shower again, it felt warm. It felt rad.   
When I would exit the shower, condensation would collect on my body, like beads of sweat. (It still does) At first, I had to call my wife into the room to touch me and tell me if I was warm or cold, she'd tell me I was cold. Condensation confirmed. WTF? Now my showers start at 3 and finish at 1\. I often take two showers a day now because I like how it makes me feel. I love it.   
In February I found myself sitting in the river by my house a few times, finding relief afterwards while meditating in the snow. After a few minutes in the river, and after the whole process of preparing myself for that dunk, I return home and feel like I just got home from a day on the mountain. So much adrenaline and energy flowing.   
O2 Saturation is a breathing skill I never knew existed. For years Yoga gurus have told me to learn to breathe. I didn't even understand that there was anything to learn. But no matter how in-depth I go here, nothing you read will help you understand more than feeling those changes yourself. So stop studying and start training your breath. The WHM is a good start.   
With that O2, I doubled my push-up max from 35 to 85\. As stated, I have shoulder problems. Pushups have been a daily therapy for more than 15 years now. 35 to 40 has always been my max. Now I crank out 85 everyday, with no air in my lungs, on one exhaled & retained breath.  
Meditation is also something many around me have told me to pick up. I didn't know how. Sit still and think of nothing? How? It felt impossible. But counting my breaths and connecting with my pulse gave me that bridge needed to enter a state of being self-aware. Meditation now starts my day, everyday. You have to experience it and get there on your own. But I mention it here because my co-workers and friends tell me they see it in my personality, that I seem more clear, focused, and happier. They're right. That practice changed my life for the better in more ways than I even understand. Meditation is something that just kind of happened along with the WHM.   
Enter health checks. I lost so much weight I thought I had cancer. I'm down to 145lbs now, the same weight as when I stopped growing in HS, and before I began drinking in college. You all know how that weight shift went, I'm sure. It's pretty standard. Anyway, I had two separate full diagnostic checks and the doctors were impressed. I'm healthy.  
My libido went up, too. I already have three kids and don't really need the libido. But, that is highly worth noting to everyone. If you like sex, it gets better. That might be enough motivation for anyone to start the program.   
I feel stronger from within. I feel like I've learned how to train the tiny muscles surrounding my capillaries. I know that sounds strange. You'll have to feel it to understand it, I think.  
Enough rambling. Fire away with any questions you may have. The Wim Hof Method is legit. It is the most profound physical training I have ever experienced. I only wish I had begun when I was younger. Better late than never, I guess. I'm stoked on it now. My kids will undergo the same.
