The most important pop culture song of the rap game is at an intersection with the business hustlers and digital nomads of the word. 

I'm sure most of us aren't taking this Instagram game as seriously as we should be. Completely oblivious to the back end of www.facebook.com/business until the weekend prior, I was thinking the same as everyone else: that Facebook is just a giant web connecting people and Instagram is just an app for posting pictures. 

Outside the magnificence of the technology, the lack of awareness we see for the potential business development is next to near amazing. 

Yesterday I didn't realize, but now I do.
