# What is the Cherry Business? And what it looks like at this point. 

The cherry is that thing on top. The top being the last and most noticeable thing in view. The top is where people look and see an end result. The top is where micromanaging doesn't need to happen because systems are in place. 

Every day we forfeit the luxury to only eat cherries, too be placing cherries on things means you've put the rest of the baking team to work. You've created the cake and now you get to add the final piece.. that little thing on top is being first and finishing strong everyday. 

What I'm doing right now is building the kitchen while mixing ingredients. Every months our videos add a new layer and additional ingredient keep getting added to the mix. 

My mix is the Helio Story.
