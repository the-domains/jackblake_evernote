            <title><![CDATA[An important concept I hope my audience understands is that I'm not a creator by typical definition. I'm documenting my lifestyle and these guys and the lifestyle they promote is what I love showing you guys. This statement is fun for anyone trying to start something for the first time. Document what your doing, and leverage what you discover later. It doesn't have to be pretty just valuable.
